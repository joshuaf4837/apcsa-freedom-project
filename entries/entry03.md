# Entry 3
##### 1/5/20
Recap: This past month I have been continuing my research with Unity, playing with templates, watching videos on Unity and I also began completing lessons with C#. I have outlined what I wanted to create and combined to gaming genres together. I was thinking and will most likely be commuting to building an FPS combined with RPG and Platforming.

Engineering Design Process: In the Engineering Design Process I am at step 4 leaning towards step 5 . I am still planning but I am confident with what I want to do. After tinkering so much I think I am ready to start my prototype. I will be officially start coding this week which means my prototype has started.

Knowledge: In class, I am constantly watching Unity tutorials and on w3schools.com practicing C#. I have learned the basics of C# over the past few weeks. Luckily, Java and C# are very similar. In class, We have been learning the Java language therefore the learning process for C# was easier than it would be if I never had knowledge on Java

Skills: A skill I have obtained was **TIME MANAGEMENT**. I was able to set up as schedule where I can work on my "freedom project" without any interruptions. Creating a schedule for the project allowed me to be more efficient with my work and get more than I thought completed in the planning process. I was able to think more clearly without any distractions. Another skill I developed was **HOW TO GOOGLE**. Knowing what I needed to search was very beneficial and came in handy with my time management. I would look up anything Unity related and also look up why C# is important with Unity and why it is used. These two skills are extremely helpful and will help me all the way doing this project.
