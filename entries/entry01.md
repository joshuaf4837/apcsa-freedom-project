### Tool ideas?
A tool I considered / had in mind was **Unity**, while searching for tools I came across the Unity website and it really caught my attention with all the features it includes. I always kept this in mind because knowing what Unity could do really benefits by base idea of making something for entertainment purposes.
### Tool commitment
 I finally commited too using Unity because I am familar with the concept and engine. In the past I have played many computer games that run on Unity and It would be very intresting if I could build my own game on the same platform, the idea of having others play my game on a regular basis feels great.
### What I'm making
 What i want too make is too make a 3d game in general. Im still not sure what the concept of the game will be, but it will be sure to run on all/ most PC platforms.
