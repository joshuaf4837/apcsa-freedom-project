## Unity
I have came to the conclusion that I will be using Unity for my "Freedom Project".
On unity I have tinkered with the templates and checked out the “platformer” and “fps” platformer. I know that this is the tool I will be using but I'm still having trouble deciding on what game i want to create.


## C# (C sharp)
This week after researching and tinkering by using templates, I discovered I have to use a script called **“C#”.** C# is a microsoft programming language. This week will consist of continuing to learn script, I will be able to catch on quickly because it is similar to Java and that is I'm learning in class yearlong.

## Engineering Design Process
The weeks I have spent working on this consisted of watching and learning. I watched many tutorials on using Unity. In class my computer did not have Unity downloaded until recently so I never got the time to tinker with it in class. I downloaded at home and used a couple templates. So far I have used the 2d template, 3d template , and "3d with extra" template.

I planned out in a google doc what my game will consist of.I've constantly been asking myself questions like what kind of game would I find the most interesting. I play all types of video games and I find each unique and entertaining so all I had to do was decide which direction i was going . What i had in mind was what if i could combine both a platformer and fps game and make it into one.

## Skills
The skills I obtained was being able to use some **C#.** It relates to **java** in many ways so it was simple for me to get around, I feel like I didnt have to learn from scratch and the beginning. I also learned how the game physics work in Unity, They work like real life physics. I wanted to make my game have a realistic feel to it and knowing that real life physics is applied it helps a lot.
